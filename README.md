# G.A.V.O. - GAMEBOT WITH ARTIFICIAL VISION USING OPENCV

The present project intends to automatize the gameplay of a basic video game through the capture of various images from  the computer's screen applying object detection techniques for doing determinate actions.

### Objective 1

Create a computer vision system that recognizes objects in a video game to automate the gameplay.


### Objective 2

Analyze different types of object detection techniques to improve the autonomy of video game control.


### About Our Artificial Vision System

G.A.V.O. is a computer vision system that was developed in C++ using OpenCV for the logic and Qt for the GUI. The main reason to use Qt is that OpenCV alone does not provide tools for creating efficient GUIs.

Our AV system allows the computer play by its own a basic video game. In this case, we used a 1982 Atari game called Moon Patrol. The computer make decisions based on object detection techniques like Haar Cascades or Template Matching.
